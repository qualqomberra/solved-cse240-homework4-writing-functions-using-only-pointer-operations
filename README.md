<h1>Programming Assignment</h1>




<ol>

 <li>You are given a C file hw04q1.c which contains a partially completed program. Follow the instructions contained in comments and complete the required functions. You will be writing most functions (initializeStrings, printStrings, toUppercase, toLowercase, changeAllToUpperOrLower, wordMatch, concatStr) using <strong>only </strong>pointer operations instead of using array operations. In this homework, the arrays in all functions need to be accessed with pointer, not as array. It means you cannot use an array element value through indexing like s[0][0] or s[i][j]. However, you can use the addresses of some array elements, such as &amp;s[0][0] and &amp;s[i][0]. Then, you use the pointer to access the array element value. You will be using a character pointer. You may use only the strlen( ) function from string.h library. You can find out more about these functions by reading through the instructions in the hw04q1.c file. Example output is given below.</li>
